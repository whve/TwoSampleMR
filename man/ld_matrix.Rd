\title{Get LD matrix for list of SNPs}
\usage{
ld_matrix(snps, with_alleles = TRUE, pop = "EUR")
}
\arguments{
\item{snps}{List of SNPs.}

\item{with_alleles}{Whether to append the allele names to the SNP names. The default is \code{TRUE}.}

\item{pop}{Super-population to use as reference panel. Default = "EUR". Options are EUR, SAS, EAS, AFR, AMR. 'legacy' also available - which is a previously used verison of the EUR panel with a slightly different set of markers}
}
\value{
Matrix of LD r values
}
\description{
This function takes a list of SNPs and searches for them in 502 European samples from 1000 Genomes phase 3 data.
It then creates an LD matrix of r values (signed, and not squared).
All LD values are with respect to the major alleles in the 1000G dataset. You can specify whether the allele names are displayed.
